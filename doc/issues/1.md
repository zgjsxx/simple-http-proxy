# Issue1

**Issue**: myproxy occupy 800M memory and after all the connection is close, the memory does not release. But valgrind does not find memory leak.

**Reason**: 
Glic does not return memory size which is less than 128k to OS after free.

If you want to return the memory to OS instantly, you need to use malloc_trim(0).

You can see the demo from [demo](../../research/malloc/memory_free.cpp).
