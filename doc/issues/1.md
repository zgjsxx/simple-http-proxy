# Issue1

**Issue**: Just one htts connection costs 4M memcory and when the connection is closed, program still occupy 4M mem.

**Reason**: preliminary locate it is caused by openssl handshake

refer to the demo program src/demo/ssl_client.cpp, compile and run it
```shell
./ssl_client 93.184.216.34 443
```

Its output is on below:
```shell

You can see that when we free the openssl ssl and ctx, it still occypt 6M. It means that openssl has some cache.
